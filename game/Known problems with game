You cannot use the same Combination-object in several WinningConditions which are used in the same game.
The problem is caused in WinningCondition.isFulfilled() when removeUsedFace() is called. removeUsedFace() removes the face
that was just used in the previous combination which was fulfilled from all other combinations in the WinningCondition.
