You cannot use the same Combination-object in several WinningConditions which are used in the same game.
The problem is caused in WinningCondition.isFulfilled() when removeUsedFace() is called. removeUsedFace() removes the face
that was just used in the previous combination which was fulfilled from all other combinations in the WinningCondition.

If SaveDie(index) is used and then later used again with an index higher than the previous one you may not get the result you want
since the previous die has been removed and the list has been changed.
